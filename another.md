this is us creating another file because sam went to buy water and we want to wait for him and we are bored
Sam is not back seem, Seem like he went far and doesnt want to come back and we are not ahppy about that, Please! Please, Sam come back we miss you already
Confidence now has gone to repark we are now left alone to figure out things with out him, How do we cope with confidence. though we have confidence in Christ Jesus.
